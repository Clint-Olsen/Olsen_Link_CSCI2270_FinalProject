# Olsen_Link_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This project will focus on building a program that simulates a vending machine.
The vending machine will keep track of the stock of various items and how much these items cost.
The program will also incorporate basic vending machine functions such as restocking, vending items, and displaying prices. 

Overview:
This program builds a simulated vending machine through an array of linked lists. Each memeber of the array is the head pointer of a doubly linked list that each represent the different rows of the vedning machine. The linked list is comprised of nodes that are defined by the structure vendingItem, and contain information such as the item name, price, quantity, and next and previous pointers. The user is able to explore a variety of features such as viewing the status of the vending machine, making purchases, and entering an administrator menu that allows for more detatiled changes. The vending machine also attempts to simulate reality by occassionally becoming stuck!
