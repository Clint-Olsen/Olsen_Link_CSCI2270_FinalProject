# Olsen_Link_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This project will focus on building a program that simulates a vending machine.
The vending machine will keep track of the stock of various items and how much these items cost.
The program will also incorporate basic vending machine functions such as restocking, vending items, and displaying prices.
