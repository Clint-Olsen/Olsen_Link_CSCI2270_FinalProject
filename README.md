# Olsen_Link_CSCI2270_FinalProject
We are going to build a program that simulates a vending machine.
Our vending machine will keep track of stock of various items and what row each item is on.
The Program will also incorporate basic vending machine functions such as restocking, vending items and displaying prices.
